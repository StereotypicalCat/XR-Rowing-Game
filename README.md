# XR-Rowing-Game
A rowing game for kids based on External Reality concepts
## What?
This project is meant to be a small game for children, which helps teaching them how to cooperate. Paddles from the real world are connected to an Arduino, which sends it input to Unity, where the game plays out, and the children have to evade obstacles and ollect collectables in order to go to the next zone.
## WIP
This project is Work-In-Progress and will be updated until this WIP section is removed.
